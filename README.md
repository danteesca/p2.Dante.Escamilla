### About The Mirror:

In my mirror I chose to take a fairly symetrical design pattern with a number of pages that can be toggled between, with the clock and notification center being up at the top of the screen and out of the way. I could see this posing a problem for someone taller in stature however, for most people it should work just fine. The other elements are lower down but farther off to the side so that they will be easier to interact with but kept out of the way of the focal point of the mirror, the center. I wanted to keep the center of the mirror open so the elements are pushed to the edges but they are moveable so, depending on the person or the task at hand, they are free to find where the elements feel most comfortable. Below is a screenshot of the mirror so that the basic design of the interface can be seen.
